abstract = {The effect of barrier width on the exciton states in coupled quantum wells has been theoretically studied using an efficient approach. By solving the Schrödinger equation in real space, the electron and hole energies and wave functions are calculated in the presence of an applied electric field. It is found that with zero electric field the energy splitting of the doublets is large in the case of thin barrier width. However for thicker barrier width, the Stark effect is stronger at large electric field. The exciton states, binding energies and oscillator strength are also calculated as a function of electric field. There is shown the direct-to-indirect crossover of the exciton ground state at approximately F=10 kV/cm and F=5 kV/cm for Lb=2 nm and Lb=4 nm respectively, corresponding to the dramatic decrease of its binding energy and oscillator strength. This direct-to-indirect crossover happens at lower electric field for thicker barrier width. We have also studied the light–matter coupling and calculated the DX, IX and CM components of the polariton states as a function of electric field.}
