abstract="Quantum mechanics theory about photoluminescence is first introduced then applied to various case studies to understand the microscopic processes, namely photon excitation, energy relaxation and radiative recombination, involved in the photoluminescence spectroscopy in semiconductor structures ranging from bulk to nanoscale. The study is further deepened by analyzing the photoluminescence spectra of quantum dots under the multiphoton excitation.",
