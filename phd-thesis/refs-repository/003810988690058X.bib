abstract = {We have measured the room temperature photoreflectance spectrum from a 100A/150A GaAs/GaAlAs multiple quantum well (MQW) (x â‰ˆ 0.17). The entire spectrum from the MQW has been fit by a third-derivative functional form lineshape expression. In addition to all the allowed quantum transitions we have clearly observed features from several symmetry forbidden transitions. There also appears to be evidence for unconfined transitions, i.e. energies above the band gap of the GaAlAs barrier layer. There is good agreement between the experimentally determined energies of the various features and a theoretical calculation.}
