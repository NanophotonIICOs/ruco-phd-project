	journal = {Semiconductor Science and Technology},
	abstract = {The emission and absorption spectra of quantum wells containing electron or hole gas are reviewed. We show that trions, also known as charged excitons, play a dominant role in determining these spectra. We discuss issues related to their behaviour at zero and high magnetic fields, their far-field and near-field spectra, and their role as a probe for delicate correlations of the surrounding electron gas.}
