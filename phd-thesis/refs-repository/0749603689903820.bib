abstract = {The electronic and optical properties of the ground state of the excitonic trions corresponding to an exciton bound to an electron or a hole are studied theoretically for 2D semiconductors in the whole range of the electron-to-hole effective mass ratio. The energies are calculated variationally using a 22-terms Hylleraas-type trial wave function. It is confirmed that, as in the 3D case, the 2D trions are stable for any value of the effective mass ratio. The binding energies amount to about ten times those we obtain in the 3D case using the same wave function. Therefore, the experimental observation of the trions should be very more easy in 2D than in 3D semiconductors. We deduce the shape of the lines arising from transitions between free electrons or holes and 2D excitonic trions states and compare it to the 3D results.}
