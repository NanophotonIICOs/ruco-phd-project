abstract="Optical spectroscopy is studied when a periodic external perturbation, such as an electromagnetic fieldElectromagnetic field, temperature, and static pressure or uniaxial stress, is applied to the semiconductor during the process of experimental measurement. The modulation spectroscopy, i.e., the change of the optical spectrum produced by the external perturbation, rather than the absolute spectrum itself, reveals many fine structures in the electronic energy diagram of the semiconductor.",
