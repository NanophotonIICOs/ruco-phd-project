abstract = {This article reviews the current status of spin dynamics in semiconductors which has achieved much progress in the recent years due to the fast growing field of semiconductor spintronics. The primary focus is on the theoretical and experimental developments of spin relaxation and dephasing in both spin precession in the time domain and spin diffusion and transport in the spatial domain. A fully microscopic many-body investigation on spin dynamics based on the kinetic spin Bloch equation approach is comprehensively reviewed.}
