\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Band energy diagram for insulators (left), semiconductors(center) and metals (right). The principal difference is the gap energy, for insulators this is longer than semiconductors, although in semiconductors gap energy depends on materials, finally in metals doesn't exist gap energy instead exist an overlap bands characterize these. Dashed line determine Fermi's level. \relax }}{4}{figure.caption.10}%
