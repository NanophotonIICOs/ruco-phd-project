Modification of these structures to confine the electrons to one dimension (quantum wires) or release them in the third dimension, are predicted to lead to new electrical and optical properties. This article discusses techniques to make quantum wires, and quantum wells of controlled size and shape, from compound semiconductor materials, and describes some of the properties of these structures.},

	abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

The entire spectrum from the MQW has been fit by a third-derivative functional form lineshape expression. In addition to all the allowed quantum transitions we have clearly observed features from several symmetry forbidden transitions. There also appears to be evidence for unconfined transitions, i.e. energies above the band gap of the GaAlAs barrier layer. There is good agreement between the experimentally determined energies of the various features and a theoretical calculation.}

abstract = {The effect of barrier width on the exciton states in coupled quantum wells has been theoretically studied using an efficient approach. By solving the Schrödinger equation in real space, the electron and hole energies and wave functions are calculated in the presence of an applied electric field. It is found that with zero electric field the energy splitting of the doublets is large in the case of thin barrier width. However for thicker barrier width, the Stark effect is stronger at large electric field. The exciton states, binding energies and oscillator strength are also calculated as a function of electric field. There is shown the direct-to-indirect crossover of the exciton ground state at approximately F=10 kV/cm and F=5 kV/cm for Lb=2 nm and Lb=4 nm respectively, corresponding to the dramatic decrease of its binding energy and oscillator strength. This direct-to-indirect crossover happens at lower electric field for thicker barrier width. We have also studied the light–matter coupling and calculated the DX, IX and CM components of the polariton states as a function of electric field.}

The energies are calculated variationally using a 22-terms Hylleraas-type trial wave function. It is confirmed that, as in the 3D case, the 2D trions are stable for any value of the effective mass ratio. The binding energies amount to about ten times those we obtain in the 3D case using the same wave function. Therefore, the experimental observation of the trions should be very more easy in 2D than in 3D semiconductors. We deduce the shape of the lines arising from transitions between free electrons or holes and 2D excitonic trions states and compare it to the 3D results.}

	journal = {Nanotechnology},
	abstract = {Low-temperature (T≈2 K) photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra of GaAs/AlGaAs (x = 0.05) structures with shallow quantum wells (QWs) were investigated. It was found that the PLE spectra exhibit a number of broad bands in the above-barrier energy region; these bands alternate `in opposite phases' in the spectra of free excitons and excitonic complexes (trions) (i.e. an increase in the exciton luminescence intensity is accompanied by a decrease in the luminescence intensity of the complexes). Effects originating from simultaneous irradiation of the sample by two laser beams of different wavelengths were studied. In the case where the photon energy of the Ti-sapphire laser is tuned to excite only the QW states, additional pumping by a He-Ne or Ar-ion laser results in the shift of the equilibrium in the exciton-trion system towards an increase in the concentration of the latter species. On the other hand, upon excitation into certain barrier states with energies both below and above the barrier bandgap, additional pump shifts the equilibrium in the opposite direction.}

For each of these materials the theory uses only thirteen parameters to reproduce the major features of conduction and valence bands. The matrix elements exhibit chemical trends: the differences in diagonal matrix elements are proportional to differences in free-atom orbital energies and the off-diagonal matrix elements obey the d−2 rule of Harrison et al. The lowest energy conduction bands are well described as a result of the introduction of an excited s state, s∗. on each atom. Examination of the chemical trends in this sp3s∗ model yields a crude but “universal” sp3s∗ model whose parameters do not depend explicitly on band gaps, but rather are functions of atomic energies and bond lengths alone. The “universal” model, although cruder than the sp3s∗ model for any single semiconductor, can be employed to study relationships between the band structures of different semiconductors; we use it to predict band edge discontinuities of heterojunctions.}

This new method is based on both a generalization and a novel application to microstructures of the Luttinger-Kohn envelope-function expansion. The differences between this new method and the conventional envelope-function method are emphasized. An alternative derivation of the new envelope-function equations, which are exact, to that already published is provided. A new and improved derivation of the author's effective-mass equation is given, in which the differences in the zone-centre eigenstates of the constituent crystals are taken into account. The cause of the kinks in the conventional effective-mass envelope function, at abrupt effective-mass changes, is identified.}

abstract="The intent of this book is to demonstrate the importance of symmetry in determining the properties of solids and the power of using group theory and tensor algebra to elucidate these properties. It is not meant to be a comprehensive text on solid state physics, so many important aspects of condensed matter physics not related to symmetry are not covered here. The book begins by discussing the concepts of symmetry relevant to crystal structures. This is followed by a summary of the basics of group theory and how it is applied to quantum mechanics. Next is a discussion of the description of the macroscopic properties of crystals by tensors and how symmetry determines the form of these tensors. The basic concepts covered in these early chapters are then applied to a series of different examples. There is a discussion of the use of point symmetry in the crystal field theory treatment of point defects in solids. Next is a discussion of crystal symmetry in determining the optical properties of solids, followed by a chapter on the nonlinear optical properties of solids. Then the role of symmetry in treating lattice vibrations is described. The last chapter discusses the effects of translational symmetry on electronic energy bands in solids.",

This chapter describes the work of Pierre Curie on symmetry. Pierre Curie is well known to the wide scientific community as an author of outstanding works on radioactivity but almost unknown as an author of deep investigations on symmetry and its applications in physics. Pierre Curie was the first to single out the symmetry groups, which is currently called the limiting point groups especially important in physics. Altogether, there are seven such groups. They can readily be remembered if one wishes to consider the simplest figures possessing such symmetry. Using the limiting symmetry groups, Pierre Curie has established for the first time one of the most important features, distinguishing an electric field from a magnetic one, and thus managed to explain why, contrary to the case of positive and negative charges, north magnetism cannot be distinguished from south magnetism. Physicists before Pierre Curie were interested mainly in the similarity rather than in differences between the magnetic and electric fields. This standpoint was supported even by mathematicians. Pierre Curie was really ahead of his contemporaries when he discovered an essential difference between the symmetries of magnetic and electric fields overlooked by the others.}

	abstract = {The electron effective g factor tensor in asymmetric III–V semiconductor quantum wells (AQWs) and its tuning with the structure parameters and composition are investigated with envelope-function theory and the Kane model. The spin-dependent terms in the electron effective Hamiltonian in the presence of an external magnetic field are treated as a perturbation and the g factors and , for the magnetic field in the QW plane and along the growth direction, are obtained analytically as a function of the well width L. The effects of the structure inversion asymmetry (SIA) on the electron g factor are analyzed. For the g-factor main anisotropy in AQWs, a sign change is predicted in the narrow well limit due to SIA, which can explain recent measurements and be useful in spintronic applications. Specific results for narrow-gap and AQWs are presented and discussed with the available experimental data; in particular InAs QWs are shown to not only present much larger g factors but also a larger g-factor anisotropy, and with the opposite sign with respect to GaAs QWs.}

abstract = {Circularly polarized photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measured at 19K on GaAs/AlGaAs symmetric and asymmetric double quantum wells (DQW) is reported. The PL is obtained by exciting the sample with a circularly polarized (left or right) laser in order to create an initial unbalanced distribution of electron spins in the conduction band and, in this way, obtain the electron spin lifetime τ s . The effects of the excitation laser wavelength are estimated by exciting with laser wavelengths of 701.0, 787.0, 801.5, and 806.5nm. The increase of τ s with the excitation wavelength is attributed to the lower initial quasimomentum k of the excited carriers, which also reduces spin–orbit relaxation processes. τ s is found to be higher in asymmetric DQWs: this is attributed to the wider QWs in these samples, which reduces spin relaxation due to the Dresselhaus mechanism. In addition, a smaller contribution from the Rashba mechanism is also detected by comparing samples with built-in electric fields of different orientations defined by doped barrier layers.}

abstract = {The band structure of InSb is calculated using the k ·. p perturbation approach and assuming that the conduction and valence band extrema are at k = 0. The small band gap requires an accurate treatment of conduction and valence band interactions while higher bands are treated by perturbation theory. A highly nonparabolic conduction band is found. The valence band is quite similar to germanium. Energy terms linear in k which cannot exist in germanium are estimated and found to be small, though possibly of importance at liquid-helium temperature. An absolute calculation of the fundamental optical absorption is made using the cyclotron resonance mass for n-type InSb. The agreement with experimental data for the fundamental absorption and its dependence on n-type impurity concentration is quite good. This evidence supports the assumptions made concerning the band structure.}

	abstract = {The effective mass approximation (EMA) could be an efficient method for the computational study of semiconductor nanostructures with sizes too large to be handled by first-principles calculations, but the scheme to accurately and reliably introduce EMA parameters for given nanostructures remains to be devised. Herein, we report on an EMA approach based on first-principles-derived data, which enables accurate predictions of the optoelectronic properties of quantum nanostructures. For the CdS/ZnS core/shell quantum rods, for which we recently reported its experimental synthesis, we first carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations for an infinite nanowire to obtain the nanoscopic dielectric constant, effective mass, and Kohn-Sham potential. The DFT-derived data are then transferred to the finite nanorod cases to set up the EMA equations, from which we estimate the photoluminescence (PL) characteristics. Compared with the corresponding method based on bulk EMA parameters and abrupt potential, we confirm that our EMA approach more accurately describes the PL properties of nanorods. We find that, in agreement with the experimentally observed trends, the optical gap of nanorods is roughly determined by the nanorod diameter and the PL intensity is reduced with increasing the nanorod length. The developed methodology is additionally applied to CdSe nanoplatelets, where reliable experimental data became recently available. Here, we again obtain excellent agreements between calculated and measured optical gap values, confirming the generality of our approach. It is finally shown that the abrupt confinement potential approximation most adversely affects the accuracy of EMA simulations.}

    abstract = { In this work the finite-difference method (FDM) is presented for the undoped Hg1-xCdxTe/HgTe quantum well (QW) which allows to calculate the band structures based on Kane's $8\times8$ kp model including all second-order terms representing the remote-band contributions. In particular the common central-difference form is employed in the discretization procedure. The FDM is applied in the envelope function approach (EFA) for the [001]-oriented system for two cases: without a magnetic field (B = 0) and with a magnetic field perpendicular to the layer (B∥z). A proposed presented method can solve all the states simultaneously and can be used for a wide range of temperatures and widths of QW for different values of x for Hg1-xCdxTe/HgTe QW as well as for more complex structures, e.g., asymmetric QW, double quantum wells (DQWs), multiple quantum wells (MQWs) and for the so-called 3D topological insulator with a strained HgTe layer. The results obtained by this method are in a complete agreement with the previous ones. Based on that it is shown that the different x-Cd compounds in the barrier as well as in the QW make the critical width different than 6.4 nm for HgTe QW. What is also very interesting from the application point of view of the strained mixed HgCdTe QW is that for a different width and a different mismatch lattice it is possible to observe the influence of the upper and lower parts of the Dirac cone in, e.g., a magneto-transport experiment. }

Poisson's ratio of AlAs is deduced from the x-ray diffraction data based on two assumptions for the relationship between the AlGaAs lattice constant and its composition. For the first, Vegard's law is assumed and Poisson's ratio is found to be 0.255±0.004, which is much lower than expected ({\textgreater}0.31 for III-V semiconductor materials). However, higher values of 0.322±0.004 and 0.328±0.004 are obtained when assuming nonlinear relationships proposed in two previous studies. These high values are in excellent agreement with those obtained by independent measurements.
